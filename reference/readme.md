# Reference solution
This directory contains Kathy's reference solution for group project assignments up to this point. You are free to use
your team's own code as a basis for the next group project, but you can also incorporate pieces of this reference
solution (or just take it wholesale) when working on subsequent project assignments. If you do this, please just
include comments in the relevant part of the code to let me know what you are using.

It is _just barely_ possible that there may be an error in this reference solution. If you identify one, please
[let Kathy know](mailto:klenth@westminstercollege.edu) ASAP so that she can notify the rest of the class!

The reference solution will always encompass at least the features required for a large team (four students) but may go
above that point. If you use the reference solution you are **not** required to carry any such additional features into
subsequent team project assignments (e.g., just because the grammar supports exception handlers, that doesn't mean that
you need to generate code for them â€” unless of course you are required to do this anyway!).
