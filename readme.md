# Group project 2: Syntactic analyzer

This is the starting project for GP2. The subdirectories are...
 * `.idea`: IDEA project files
 * `gen`: generated sources directory (ANTLR places lexer/parser here)
 * `grammar`: holds your lexer/parser grammar rules (.g4 files)
 * `lib`: holds needed libraries (in this case just ANTLR4)
 * `reference`: Kathy's reference solution for GP1 (lexical analyzer)
 * `src`: where Java code goes; if you write any Java (tests, perhaps?) you could put it here. There is no requirement
   for this project that there be anything in this directory, however.
 * `test`: test input for your parser
    * `test/group0`: input files using only syntax from "Group 0" — every team's parser should be able to parse these
    * `test/group1`: input files using syntax from "Group 1" — the larger teams' parsers should be able to parse them
