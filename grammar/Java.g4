/* ---- Parser rules ---- */

/* ---- Lexer rules ---- */
// Lexer rules go here. You can either...
//   a) copy-paste your lexer rules from GP1 here (or just replace this file entirely); or
//   b) use part (or all) of the GP1 reference solution in reference/grammar/Java.g4 as a starting point.
// If you use the reference solution, please explain in comments what you take from it so that Kathy can keep track of
// what you're starting from!
